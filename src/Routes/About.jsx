//           I have been flying since, trying to see the world in a completely new way, from above. 
//           I specifically enjoy capturing content of vehicles, their mechanical operation, their speed and power, their engaging appearance, and the sound of when they takeoff.

//       <p>  Moments in time are so precious. They can be the moment you married your significant other, spent quality time with someone not knowing it would be the last, played with your children or pets knowing they are only this age once, celebrating your own achievements The list is endless.
// These moments can also be quite unfortunate and may be with people, places, or objects that will no longer be in our lives. 
// But, these moments shape us to be who we are today.</p>
